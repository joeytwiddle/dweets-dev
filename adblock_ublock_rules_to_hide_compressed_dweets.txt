See: https://www.dwitter.net/d/16644 (if no dweet shows on that page, then you may need to disable your adblocker!)

In UBlock I added these rules:

```
www.dwitter.net##.dweet-wrapper:has(:contains(eval):contains(unescape))

beta.dwitter.net##.card:has(:contains(eval):contains(unescape))
```

Note: If you add rules using the element picker, then you don't need the domain name at the front.
