OK, I have managed to delete it. #4780 by LU22BR1GHTY3AR

It was difficult because the page kept crashing!

In the end this worked:
1. Make my browser window 300px high, so the dweet won't start auto-playing.
2. Jump to the bottom of the page using browser console: window.scroll(0, 9999)
3. Scroll up until I can see the dweet code, and edit it to not crash.
4. Scroll up some more and click the 'delete' button.

Happy New Year!
