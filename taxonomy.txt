There are a few effects (dwitter idioms?) that seem to crop up very often:

1. Sine waves (henceforth forever knows as "swine waves")

2. Spirals

3. Moire (interference patterns on a 2d grid)

4. 1d interference patterns resulting from sampled sine waves or spirals (https://www.dwitter.net/d/739)

5. The binary boxy one I can't describe which might be related to Sierpinski (https://www.dwitter.net/d/7815)

6. The circles fractal (which is a specific type of Moire I guess)

Did I miss any? Would you categorise them differently?(edited)
